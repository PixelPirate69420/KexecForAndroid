# KexecForAndroid
Hello, this repository contains a Linux tool called "kexec" which I ported for Android ARM devices(Tablets/Phones, etc). 
Its purpose is to change temporarily the kernel of you Android device without a special ROM image

Prerequisites:
A rooted Android device which has an ARM cpu, basically almost anything that runs android.

Step 1: Copy both the files.
Step 2: Paste them into system/bin or system/xbin or just a plain folder.
Step 3: Execute them with root privileges using a terminal emulator or ADB.
Step 4: Run --help to test if it runs properly.
Step 5: Now you can use this tool as if you would be on a Linux machine

Enjoy!!
